# React Maps

This library is wrapper around `@bratislava/react-mapbox`.

It provides useful functionalities and components:

- Main `<Map />` component for **slots**, **theme** and **responsivity** handling.
- `<Layout />` and `<Slot />` for management of all responsive floating elements on top of map.
- `<SearchBar />` and `<SearchMarker />` components connected to underlying mapbox instance.
- `<ThemeController />` for darkmode handling.
- `<ViewportController />` for map movement button controls.
- `<Detail />` component for marker or polygon detail showing.

## Design

This library should reflect our design system available in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/Wv7IU3KeHl7vJeAUxp8461/Mestsk%C3%A9-mapy?t=wRnz86eSzd3ZtxQd-0).
